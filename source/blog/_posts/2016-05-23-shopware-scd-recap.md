Last friday was the Shopware Community Day 2016 - aka SCD. My frist Community Day as a shopware employee. It was different. But great.

As naive as I am, I imagined that I could visit the different talks just like I would normally do. Like a visitor. Or strave around the grounds of the SCD. Like a visitor. How foolish. This idea was smashed quite a few days before the SCD started and I abandoned the idea of poodling around the whole day. Of course.

But as lucky as I am, this is Shopware. Not any other ordinary company. So we had a few tasks in addition to the general roomkeeping, the ordinary sales talks and playing the general servant. I was lucky enough to be assigned to the Deepsea Labs as a stand-by man. Again, lucky enough, the lab was not as deepsea as the name suggested so I kept my feet dry. In the Labs we had the nice task to explain different bleeding edge technologies, devices and toys to our visitors and customers. These tools were boroughed from our Open Device Lab, and as time and space were limited we have shown these:
Amazon Echo, Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon Dash, Myo Band, Muse Headband, Microsoft Kinect, Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, VR Headset from Zeiss, HTC Vive, Beacons, LifX Light Bulbs, Google's project Tango and the LEAP motion... that should've been it. I guess. Its quite a lot of stuff and most of it has not been seen or experienced my most of our visitors. At least the reactions second this. Many of them were amazed an stunned by the way especially VR works and how smooth it is.

As I was a stand-by man, one might guess that I had quite a lot of spare time. In reality I was jumping in between the different counters (HTC Vive, other VR stuff, LEAP motion and the "internet of things") and had a lot of interesting conversations with all kind of different people. In addition to this I set up the "new" computer that we had to use for the Oculus, as the one that was planned died away just about half an hour before the first visitors arrived. So much fun. 

So there was not all too much of spare time to discover the different counters in the fair, attend in talks or take a rest. But I somehow managed to go to the Shopware connect talk, as I am working on this project and I was eager to see and hear the reactions. And in the evening - just right before they closed - I managed to try the ocean dive. A drop from about 8m into a big cushion. The heaviest part was not the jumping, but getting out of that wobbly mess... But it was awesome :)

At the end we have build back our counters in record time and after the we went to the bamboo for the first beers and burgers of the day. And for the great after show party. It was amazing! Even though we had a little bit of rain in between... But somewhen my voice cracked away, my head was throbbing and I was pretty tired... so I grabbed my phone, called my wife and went home.

Conclusion:

The SCD 2016 was amazing. Even as an employee. Even though I have seen barely more then the Deepsea Labs. And I am already looking forward to the next SCD, I am curious where our journey will lead to and what we will encounter in the next months, and if we can amaze the people again, just like this year :)
